For my programming project, I have paired up with fellow peer Adam Seidel, to take part in a programming competition run by foreign exchange company: Optiver.

It is a student coding competition based on algorithmic trading.

In this global competition, we have been asked to build and optimise a trading algorithm for Optiver's simulated market exchange. The two financial instruments in question is OPTI-ETF (a simulated ETF) and OPTI-FUTURE (the corresponding future option, also of course simulated.)

Optiver have been kind enough to have some pre-recorded video lectures explaining the basics of what we are to do, and some information regarding the two financial intruments and their relations.

The short videos include subject matters such as: 
- Introduction to financial markets
- Market participants - The role of market makers
- Exchanges and order books
- Pairs trading - A market-neutral strategy
- Calculating Profit & Loss and determining your portifolio value
- How to create a 'winning' algorithm

Unfortunetly the videos are not available to the general public, and a link cannot be provided. The video themselves were somewhat brief, but allowed Adam and I to create a plan of action.

## Tasks Round 1:
### **Before the first competition deadline 12/03**

1. Research everything that we can about 'pair trading' and different trading strategies regarding it. 

2. Do some data analysis on the provided market data, to see where we would put buy and sell signals (based on the research above)

3. Debug the provided code and try to get a basic understanding

4. Get a simple code going which buys a contant volume at each buy and sell signal

## Tasks Round 2:
### **Before the final competition deadline 19/03**
1. Optimise the solution and think more about the goal 
a.) trading profitibly and
b.) in a manor which would invite more competition to a new market

## Tasks Round 3: 
### **After the final competition deadline**
1. Optimise some more



I'm excited to learn more.
