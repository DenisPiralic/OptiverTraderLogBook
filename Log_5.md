# Log 5 - Volume Continued

## Algorithm Update



## Log Goal
1. To implement a more simplistic volume adjustment on the original algorithm. Minimise computation as much as possible. 

2. Implement the moving averages and see if it does as good




## Next Steps

Though this is my final log, I will continue to play around and hopefully implement something I can use on actual markets. 

For next steps I believe I need to knuckle down on really understanding markets, and how I can manipulate them. 

Looking back, I have been looking at my logs at a data-science angle. When actually, most of the issues I encountered was figuring out how orders in the market worked. 

So I need to research more thoroughly, how making orders on a market actually works. Then I can look at making
